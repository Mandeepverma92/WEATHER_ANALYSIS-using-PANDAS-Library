# WEATHER_ANALYSIS-using-PANDAS-Library

I analyzed the "WEATHER DATASET  using Pandas library," solved important questions about this dataset, and got valuable information.

➡️Objective
The objective of this weather data analysis project is to:
✤Understand weather patterns: By analyzing weather data, we aim to find trends, seasonal behaviors, and anomalies in different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy).
✤Summarize numerical weather data: Compute summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, max, min) for weather-related parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., across various weather conditions.



➡️Observations
From the analysis of the weather dataset, we might observe the following:
✤Weather Condition vs. Temperature:
-The mean temperature varies significantly between different weather conditions (e.g., sunny days tend to have higher average temperatures compared to rainy or snowy days).
-High temperatures might often be associated with clear weather conditions.

✤Relationship Between Temperature and Humidity:
There may be an inverse correlation between temperature and humidity (e.g., on hotter days, humidity tends to be lower).
In contrast, on rainy or cloudy days, the humidity tends to be higher regardless of temperature.

✤Time-Series Analysis of Temperature:
The temperature may show clear seasonal trends over the course of the dataset. For example, temperatures might peak during summer months and dip during winter.
There could be occasional outliers, such as sudden spikes or drops in temperature, which could represent extreme weather events.

✤Effect of Weather Conditions on Wind Speed:
Wind speed may be higher on stormy or cloudy days compared to clear, calm days.
Wind speed patterns might also exhibit seasonal behavior or periodic spikes during particular weather phenomena (e.g., storms or gusty days).

✤Impact of Weather Conditions on Visibility:
-Conditions like foggy, rainy, or snowy weather tend to reduce visibility significantly compared to clear days.
-This may affect other factors such as traffic or outdoor activities, which could be inferred if visibility data exists.

➡️Conclusion
-Key weather patterns were identified, with clear relationships between temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
